`Loco` simplifies the user authentication process, allowing you to set up a new website quickly. This feature not only saves time but also provides the flexibility to focus on crafting the core logic of your application.

## Authentication Configuration

The `auth` feature comes as a default with the library. If desired, you can turn it off and handle authentication manually.

## Getting Started with a Saas App

Create your app using the [loco-cli](/docs/getting-started/tour.md) and select the `Saas app` option.

To explore the out-of-the-box auth controllers, run the following command:

```sh
$ cargo loco controller
 .
 .
 .
[POST] /auth/forgot
[POST] /auth/login
[POST] /auth/register
[POST] /auth/reset
[POST] /auth/verify
[GET] /user/current
 .
 .
 .
```

## Registering a New User

The `/auth/register` endpoint creates a new user in the database with an `email_verification_token` for account verification. A welcome email is sent to the user with a verification link.

##### Example Curl Request:

```sh
curl --location '127.0.0.1:3000/auth/register' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data-raw '{
         "name": "Loco user",
         "email": "user@loco.rs",
         "password": "12341234"
     }'
```

For security reasons, if the user is already registered, no new user is created, and a 200 status is returned without exposing user email details.

## Login

After registering a new user, use the following request to log in:

##### Example Curl Request:

```sh
curl --location '127.0.0.1:3000/auth/login' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data-raw '{
         "email": "user@loco.rs",
         "password": "12341234"
     }'
```

The response includes a JWT token for authentication, user ID, name, and verification status.

```sh
{
    "token": "...",
    "pid": "2b20f998-b11e-4aeb-96d7-beca7671abda",
    "name": "Loco user",
    "is_verified": false
}
```

- **token** - which is a JWT token which allow to create a requests to auth endpoints. in the [config](@/docs/getting-started/config.md) you can change the default `token expiration` and make sure that `secret` is different between the environments.
- **pid** - generated id when creating a new user.
- **name** - the user name.
- **is_verified** - Is a flag if the user verify his account or not.

- **Token**: A JWT token enabling requests to authentication endpoints. Refer to the [configuration documentation](@/docs/getting-started/config.md) to customize the default token expiration and ensure that the secret differs between environments.
- **pid** - A unique identifier generated when creating a new user.
- **Name** - The user's name associated with the account.
- **Is Verified** - A flag indicating whether the user has verified their account.

## Account Verification

Upon user registration, an email with a verification link is sent. Visiting this link updates the `email_verified_at` field in the database, changing the `is_verified` flag in the login response to true.

#### Example Curl request:

```sh
curl --location '127.0.0.1:3000/auth/verify' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
         "token": "TOKEN"
     }'
```

## Reset Password Flow

### Forgot Password

The `forgot` endpoint requires only the user's email in the payload. An email is sent with a reset password link, and a `reset_token` is set in the database.

#### Example Curl request:

```sh
curl --location '127.0.0.1:3000/auth/forgot' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data-raw '{
         "email": "user@loco.rs"
     }'
```

### Reset Password

To reset the password, send the token generated in the `forgot` endpoint along with the new password.

#### Example Curl request:

```sh
curl --location '127.0.0.1:3000/auth/reset' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
         "token": "TOKEN",
         "password": "new-password"
     }'
```

## Get current user

This endpoint is protected by auth middleware.

```sh
curl --location --request GET '127.0.0.1:3000/user/current' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' \
     --data-raw '{
         "email": "user@loco.rs",
         "password": "new-password"
     }'
```

## Creating an Authenticated Endpoint

To establish an authenticated endpoint, import `controller::middleware` from the `loco_rs` library and incorporate the auth middleware into the function endpoint parameters.

Consider the following example in Rust:

```rust
use axum::{extract::State, Json};
use loco_rs::{
    app::AppContext,
    controller::middleware,
    Result,
};

async fn current(
    auth: middleware::auth::Auth,
    State(ctx): State<AppContext>,
) -> Result<Json<CurrentResponse>> {
    let user = users::Model::find_by_pid(&ctx.db, &auth.claims.pid).await?;
    /// Some response
}

```
