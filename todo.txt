(1) rgen -> crate, 
(2) glue code to run 'cargo generate' when calling "rr init"







EXPERIENCE 

$ rr init
   (goes to CLI)

(production)
$ rr start





DEV
rr-cli
   ----
   cargo-generate
   "rgen"
   rr generate model ,,,
   ----
   rr start
     -> route (shell to "cargo run -- start")

      db migrate, 
      tasks

      start
      "rgen"
      init 
       (1) embed  + fflag

[ ] auth implement missing flows
 (see flows in hyperstack)
 [ ] reset passwd flow (incl. emails)
 [ ] verify user flows (incl. emails)

[ ] auth emails:
build a reasonably real auth emails: 
- base url link goes back to app to the correct controller


[ ] review error flows (controller) in register, login, something 
doesnt sit right

 
[ ] explore a testing rig: models  (incl db reset, setup, etc)
 - see how its done in eladka
   [ ] test rig

   test/
      requests/
      models/
         (requires database flushing/ truncate)
      workers/

   - mailer test mode

[ ] cleanups, API, import surface area 
[ ] experiment with writing docs -- does it make sense ?
 - example first, add micro-examples for typical tasks
 (forms, validation, etc)




tech debt (infa)
================

[ ] take care of libproc patch in sidekiq-rs
right now all cargo.tomls are patched to workaround sidekiq-rs stats issue (using a too old lib that 
conflicts with sqlx). need to refactor or get rid of that.


Eladk:
[ ] testing snapsot saved in framework and not in the src
[ ] Print Details when Booting the App. for example server ip environment relevant context server mode etc...
[ ] move DB configuration into db connect ops
[ ] Expose sea_orm to Framework: The sea_orm library is now exposed to the framework
[ ] creating example with custom task from the app and not only from the framework  
[ ] adding testing feature to cargo.toml?
[ ] Maybe adding clap as a feature to cargo.toml?
[ ] Adding tracing subscriber as a default
[ ] Addin github CI
