# Changelog

## vNext

NEW FEATURES

* refactor: local settings are now `<env>.local.yaml` and available for all environments, for example you can add a local `test.local.yaml` and `development.local.yaml`
* refactor: removed `config-rs` and now doing config loading by ourselves.
* fix: email template rendering will not escape URLs
* Config with variables: It is now possible to use [tera](https://keats.github.io/tera) templates in config YAML files

Example of pulling a port from environment:

```yaml
server:
  port: {{ get_env(name="NODE_PORT", default=3000) }}
```

It is possible to use any `tera` templating constructs such as loops, conditionals, etc. inside YAML configuration files.

* Mailer: expose `stub` in non-test

* `Hooks::before_run` with a default blank implementation. You can now code some custom loading of resources or other things before the app runs
* an LLM inference example, text generation in Rust, using an API (`examples/inference`)
