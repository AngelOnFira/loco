# see https://github.com/heim-rs/darwin-libproc/pull/9
# rusty-sidekiq needs robotty/simple-process-stats which depends on darwin-libproc, which depends on
# a too old memchr version which sqlx needs. because libproc is native and not pure rust,
# cargo cannot resolve it. so we patch the libproc dependency.
# since simple_process_stats use by rusty-sidekiq is minimal, its better to replace it with something
# that has more velocity on updating dependencies.
